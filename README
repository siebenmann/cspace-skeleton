This is a more or less current set of DWiki[1] templates and starter
pages for my techblog Wandering Thoughts[2] and the overall wiki
(CSpace[3]) that it lives in. I've put together this Git repo of them
because the tricks of DWiki's template syntax and assorted renderers
are not exactly clearly documented, so it's not clear how I'm getting
certain effects on CSpace or how to do things yourself. These will
hopefully serve as a useful example.

(At some point DWiki's template syntax may acquire comments of some
sort, which will help.)

In general, please feel free to adopt the design aesthetic and style
of all of this. Note that the core of this is not actually all that
modern and CSS-ized and flexible; the core layout is a table (with
somewhat hardcoded proportions).

These templates may require a current version of DWiki's source.
You should make sure you're up to date on the code (and the core
templates, although they rarely change) before you adopt these
into your DWiki instance.

Where the customizations are:
- templates/struct/breadcrumbs: I added a link to my main (non-dwiki)
  home page at the start of the page breadcrumbs.

- templates/Overrides/blog: where all of the specific Wandering
  Thoughts magic happens. Three of these override general templates
  (blog.tmpl, all.tmpl, blogentry.tmpl); the remainder are used by them.

- pages/blog: I've included the collection of administrative files.
  __readme is the wikitext for the blog sidebar, which you will want
  to modify (unless you want a blog sidebar that talks about me for
  some reason). This also refers to an 'AboutBlog' page in the page
  root, which I will let you write for yourself.

- Aliases/WanderingThoughts: makes 'WanderingThoughts' a wikiword.

As with the main DWiki codebase itself, you probably want to reset
the timestamps on the templates and the pages with 'make postget'.
If you've changed or added templates or pages, do 'make precommit'
to update the timestamps before you commit to git.

An incomplete list of tricks to note:
- __readme is injected through Overrides/blog/readme-dir.tmpl ->
  struct/readme-dir.tmpl -> the inject::upreadme renderer.

- getting the blog name into the 'Wandering Thoughts: Recent Entries'
  page header is accomplished by the simple method of hardcoding it
  and the HTML URL to it in Overrides/blog/blog.tmpl.

- Overrides/blog/blogrange.tmpl uses a conditional renderer to only
  show a calendar bar if you are not on the blog's front page.

- Overrides/blog/datecrumbs.tmpl contains a single space to make the
  standard untitled 'previous/next' links disappear; this is because
  we override them with a custom rendering that inserts titled links
  in a different place in the page.

- although it's not captured in this repo currently, Wandering Thoughts
  forces a blog view by having a pages/blog/.flag.prefview:blog file
  (it's used purely as a flag file, the contents don't matter).
  See pages/dwiki/NewFeatures/DefaultDirViews for more information.
- similarly, blogdir view is blocked by having a '.flag.noview:blogdir'
  in pages/blog/ and every subdirectory.
  (See pages/dwiki/NewFeatures/DisallowDirViews for commentary)

Unfortunately really doing crazy things with templates and renderers
requires a fair degree of familiarity with the actual renderers (a
number of which are not well documented; please feel free to point those
out).

== A very brief tour of how it works

Some of the following discussion assumes that you've read at least
something about DWiki's general template syntax and template usage
at
	http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/TemplateSyntax
	http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/dwiki/TemplatesUsed
(or in test/pages/dwiki/TemplateSyntax and TemplatesUsed in your DWiki
Git repo).

The standard templates blog/blogentry.tmpl and dwiki/overrides.tmpl
(used from dwiki.tmpl) look for page or directory-hierarchy specific
override templates in Overrides. The three override templates in
Overrides/blog/ will thus get used for all directory and page display
for stuff under pages/blog/ (the blog/ page directory).
